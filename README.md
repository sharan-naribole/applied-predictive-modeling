# Applied Predictive Modeling notes

My notes from [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson, a book on the practice of modeling when accuracy is the primary goal.

This book was recommended in this fantastic [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) blog titled ["Preparing for the Transition to Data Science"](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/preparing-for-the-transition-to-data-science-e9194c90b42c#.mtk8tbarz).

In this repo, I capture the key points discussed in a few of the chapters that I found to be particularly useful.
